# RedstoneInputBlock

This simple Minecraft mod adds a block that displays the amount of redstone power it receives. It is crafted with seven stone, one redstone, and one redstone torch, and can replace any other solid block in a redstone build.

This mod was created in response to a request on the Fabric Discord Server.
